# Getting Started with Sass and Koala
There are a number of different ways to use Sass. In this practical we will use Koala as it is an easy way to get up and running with Sass.

## Setting up
* Download the repository.
  * Open *index.html* and *style.scss* in a text editor.
    *style.scss* is where we will write our Sass code.
* Open the web page in a browser. Note that at the moment it doesn't have any CSS applied to it.
* Open Koala.
* Drag the folder that contains *index.html* and the sass folder into Koala.
* Koala should automatically detect the *style.scss* file.
* Right click on *style.scss* and select compile.
* Koala should generate a CSS file for you based on the *.scss* file. Check you can find this generated CSS file.
* Refresh *index.html* in a browser, it should now have some CSS applied.
* Take a moment to make sure you understand what has happened.
* The basic workflow is to make changes to *style.scss*. Koala will then compile this for us into plain CSS. We can then refresh the browser to see the changes.

## Re-write the CSS using Sass
Now experiment with the basic feature of Sass. Try the following:
1. Use Sass variables instead of hard coded font and colour names.
2. Put your variables in a separate *_vars.scss* partial file. Use an *import* to load them into *style.scss*.
    * Recently Sass have made their use of partials much more sophisticated to use *modules*.
    * This won't work when using Koala at university as it is running on an older version of Sass. We have to use the *import* feature https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import
3. Experiment with using mixins, extends and placeholders. You should be able to re-use CSS rules and reduce the number of classes used in the HTML page. Try and make your CSS efficient and easy to maintain.
